# UniTies
Have you ever felt like you are missing out on things that you would have loved to be a part of? Universities in our country all host amazing events, as you know, including but not limited to academic conferences, cultural festivals, sports competitions, charitable initiatives, social and networking gatherings, educational workshops, science and art events, and discipline-specific events showcasing student research or projects. These events welcome anyone. They are national and some of them even international. Take UniHack for example. Timisoara Romania is hosting it, but the contestants are coming from all over the country, they even come from abroad. Most of the students who heard about it were happy to come. But a problem still stands. What about the ones that didnâ€™t? I spoke with some people. Most of them heard about it by chance from a friend and were whining that their university didn't tell them, or that they didn't know where to look. With others I didn't talk about it.. because they weren't here. This is a serious problem and, surely, it is not the first time that it is happening. Imagine how many events have already been missed by a lot of people. This needs to stop. Here's an awesome idea! Our UniTies web application is meant to interconnect all of the universities in our country, all of their events, reach out and bring together all of us so we will never miss something that is of interest for us ever again.
How's the sound of that? The further step would be to go even bigger and interconnect the universities from all over the world!
Web app that gathers all the events organised by universities from the whole country into one platform, 
the app is capable of gathering information automatically through web scraping, storing it in a mongoDB database
and then passing all the information to our Web App





## Git Subtrack
With frequent commits. suggestive names and a clean folder structure, we aspire to win this track.

In one repo, we have one folder for frontend and one for backend. Each one has its own structure.
## React Subtrack
We aspire and think we deserve to win the React Substrack thanks to our beautifully coded Web App based on React and Typescript, we combine a beautiful eyecatching and modern
UI Design with an easy to understand and pleasing UX, The code structure is beautifully written and documented, marking ends of big divs and trying to explain every function
in the app.
Finally we thrived for the best performance by keeping it simple, with no animations or useless promises, everything is smooth as butter also using the help of the best of
the best database, MongoDB
## Typescript Subtrack
Before explaining ourselves, try to find atleast one infered variable, i bet you wont, we know what type is every variable user, we also know why every variable is the type
it is, we tried to use try and catching as effectively as possible,we reused the same interface as much as we could so we can keep our code as DRY as possible.
I find our web app a piece of art, us being the artist and React and Typescript the most perfectly crafted tools for this job.
## MongoDb Atlas SubTrack
Would be a shame and a waste of time to use any other Cloud Service since MongoDB is the fastest and easiest database services to implement in any website, we thinks we stand out
in our use of MongoDB thanks to our WebScrapper use, We automatically fetch data from websites and store them in our MongoDB databases, info that we will further implement in our
platform efficiently.


## Most innovative startup idea
We find UniTies a really promising project and we strongly believe that we could easily implement this idea in real life with a lot more features for students.
We all know that events are the best opportunities for students, everything is a win, we socialize and engage in networking, we make ourselves known, we gain experience,
we test our skills and a lot more.  The problem is that we are not always informed about the last events organized by other universities, and sometimes it's not really
easy to be informed since every university posts their events on their own pages, that we may not follow on social media. Then why don't group all of the events into one platform?
This is what UniTies does, and the best thing is that everything is automatic, we use a WebScraper to automatically find events data on the web, save it in our databases and
then display it on our platform. Doing this we ensure that no events are left out and the universities don't need to do anything, being able to offer our fellow students the chance
to grow their network and develop their skills as frequently as they want.
